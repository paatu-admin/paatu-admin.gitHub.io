  <h2>1. Use of Music Clips</h2>
  <p>This app includes short audio clips from Tamil songs as part of an interactive trivia experience. All music remains the property of its respective copyright holders.</p>

  <p>These clips are used under Section 52(1)(a) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, which permits limited use for purposes such as criticism, review, and incidental inclusion. In this case, the use is transformative — the clips serve as part of a memory-based challenge that highlights, celebrates, and deepens appreciation for Tamil music.</p>

  <p>Only brief excerpts are used, and they are carefully curated to complement the gameplay without replacing or competing with the original works. In fact, by encouraging recognition and rediscovery, the app helps promote interest in Tamil songs and their lasting cultural impact.</p>

  <h2>2. Fair Use (Global Users)</h2>
  <p>For users outside India (such as in the United States), this use is consistent with the principles of "fair use" under Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act, particularly as a transformative, limited use for purposes of commentary, recognition, and cultural engagement.</p>

  <h2>3. Monetization</h2>
  <p>This mobile app does not display ads, serve third-party advertising, or earn any revenue from advertising. It also does not sell, stream, or license music or movie clips in any form.</p>
  <p>Some trivia questions embed official YouTube videos, streamed directly from YouTube’s platform. Every view generated through the app is an official YouTube view, which directly increases the content owner’s traffic, watch time, and advertising revenue under YouTube’s monetization system.</p>

  <p>By channeling users toward these official sources, the app plays an active role in promoting discovery and appreciation of the original works. Users are encouraged to revisit full songs, movies, and performances on the creators’ official channels, helping to grow their audience, strengthen fan engagement, and sustain the cultural legacy of their work.</p>

  <h2>4. Rights Holders</h2>
  <p>If you are a copyright owner and believe your content has been used unfairly, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@paatu.app">support@paatu.app</a></p>

  <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>Do not record, copy, or distribute any audio clips. All music is provided strictly for in-app trivia gameplay.</p>
