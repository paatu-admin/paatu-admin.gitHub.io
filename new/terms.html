  <h2>1. Use of Music Clips</h2>
  <p>This app includes short audio clips from Tamil songs as part of an interactive trivia experience. All music remains the property of its respective copyright holders.</p>

  <p>These clips are used under Section 52(1)(a) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, which permits limited use for purposes such as criticism, review, and incidental inclusion. In this case, the use is transformative — the clips serve as part of a memory-based challenge that highlights, celebrates, and deepens appreciation for Tamil music.</p>

  <p>Only brief excerpts are used, and they are carefully curated to complement the gameplay without replacing or competing with the original works. In fact, by encouraging recognition and rediscovery, the app helps promote interest in Tamil songs and their lasting cultural impact.</p>

  <h2>2. Fair Use (Global Users)</h2>
  <p>For users outside India (such as in the United States), this use is consistent with the principles of "fair use" under Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act, particularly as a transformative, limited use for purposes of commentary, recognition, and cultural engagement.</p>

  <h2>3. Monetization</h2>
  <p>Ads and in-app purchases support the trivia gameplay experience—not specific songs or video content. We do not sell, stream, or license music or movie clips.</p>

  <p>Some trivia questions may embed official YouTube videos, which are streamed from YouTube's platform. These views contribute to the original content owner's view count and ad revenue. The app does not monetize or interfere with any YouTube content, nor does it derive income from those clips. The app actively drives discovery by directing users to official YouTube content, helping increase visibility and engagement with the original works.</p>

  <h2>4. Rights Holders</h2>
  <p>If you are a copyright owner and believe your content has been used unfairly, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@paatu.app">support@paatu.app</a></p>

  <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>Do not record, copy, or distribute any audio clips. All music is provided strictly for in-app trivia gameplay.</p>
